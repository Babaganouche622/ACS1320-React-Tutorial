## User Stories

- Mark the Entrepreneur. Mark runs his own company fully remotely, being an avid Rock climber he’s always looking for great spots outside that offer good wifi, and a fresh space to work. Mark is looking for an easy way to identify great spots that meet his wifi needs.

- Suzi is a yoga instructor. Every wednesday she runs an outdoor free event for anyone to attend in a new location. Suzi wants a way to showcase her events on the SFPOPOS site and let people know what’s going on where/when.

- Daniel is houseless. A part of the at risk community he’s looking for safety and doesn’t want to burden anyone while looking for his necessities: accessible power and public washrooms. Knowing if a site has safe use disposal would be really helpful, and knowing when events are happening would help avoid attention.
